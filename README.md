# Titanic Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive data visualization of the **Titanic dataset** using Python. The goal is to explore passenger demographics, survival rates, and relationships between key variables to uncover insights and trends.

## Tools Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – for static visualizations
- **Seaborn** – for statistical and aesthetic visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for interactive coding and visualization

## Key Visualizations
1. **Passenger Class Distribution** – Shows how passengers were distributed across 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class.  
2. **Survival Rate by Gender** – Illustrates survival differences between males and females.  
3. **Age Distribution** – Histogram showing the age range of passengers.  
4. **Correlation Matrix** – Highlights relationships between numerical features (optional).  

## Insights
- Females had higher survival rates than males.  
- Passengers in 1st class had higher survival rates compared to 3rd class.  
- Most passengers were aged between 20–40 years.  
- Fare and class are slightly correlated, indicating higher fares in 1st class.  

## How to Use
- Open the `Data_visualization.ipynb` notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.  
- Run each cell to view the visualizations and insights.
